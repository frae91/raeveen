## How to get this going?
- Please verify your SQL Database Connection Credentials in `/API/connection.json`.
- Then, create a MySQL Database according to what is written in connection.json.
- Then, run the Table Query from the file `/API/database/quiz.sql`
- I've left the TABLE Query for SQL Import in the `/API/Database` folder
- That's probably all! Woila. :D

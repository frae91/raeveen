## How to get this going?
- Please verify your SQL Database Connection Credentials in `/API/connection.json`.
- Then, create a MySQL Database according to what is written in connection.json.
- Then, run the Table Query from the file `/API/database/table_sketch.sql`
- OR if you wanna try my configuration, you can try importing `/API/database/quiz.sql`
- That's probably all! Woila. :D

# Default Username/Password (Only if you loaded my Database Configuration)
Username: admin
Password: database

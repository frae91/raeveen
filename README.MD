Drip Course Modules

Create a mini e-learning course with 3 modules, each with a quiz at the end. The user will only be able to view the course content of the next module only if he/she passed the quiz (except the first module). You can pick any topic that you like or even just use dummy data for this demo. The goal is to exhibit dripping content for the modules.

Specifications:
1. A user will sign-up and/or login to access the course.
2. Upon login, the user sees the course on the dashboard. User may opt-in to join the course - this will enable the user to view the first module from the course.
3. The user starts the first module then takes the quiz from the first module. The other 2 modules are not viewable unless he/she passes this quiz.
4. Repeat the same process for the next two modules. In the event that the user passes the quiz for the last module, the user will receive an email for his/her certification of completion.
5. [Optional] You can put in some labels or marks indicating that the quiz has been passed or the module has been completed.
